# Security Notes

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Bot Token Rotation Required

Your Telegram bot token **8392728532:AAE...** was previously committed to the GitHub repository.

### What to do:

1. **Revoke the current token** via @BotFather:
   - Send `/mybots` to @BotFather
   - Select your bot
   - Choose "API Token" → "Revoke current token"
   - Get a new token

2. **Update your .env file** with the new token:
   ```bash
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_new_token_here
   ```

3. **Restart the bot**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

### Why this matters:
Anyone with access to the GitHub repository history can see the old token and potentially:
- Send messages as your bot
- Access user data
- Perform unauthorized operations

### Prevention:
- `.env` is already in `.gitignore` (never commit it again)
- Use `.env.example` for templates (tokens never go there)
- Rotate tokens periodically

---

**This file is safe to delete after you've rotated the token.**
